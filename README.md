# PyDF
A simple tool to manipulate pdf files developed in python.

# Functions
- Remove pages from a file

This function works by choosing a file first, then inputting the number of the pages you want to keep in the entry box(starts at 1).
- Merge files


Select 2 different pdf files and click merge!


# Notes
This is my first real project in python and the code might be a bit unreadable/un-good. Therefore if have you have any comments or improvements please share!
